# Dislpay Lib

This library's purpose is to ease creation of wallmounted nodes with a display on front side. For example, signs and clocks. Display can be dynamic and/or different for each node instance.

**Limitations**: This lib uses entities to draw display. This means display has to be vertical. So display nodes are only wallmounted vertically.

**Dependancies**:default

**License**: WTFPL

**API**: See API.md document please.
